# Wordology

Ask any non-native speaker how they learned to speak such good English, and you'll generally get a response involving watching movies with subtitles, playing video games online, or living in an English-speaking country. You don't learn a language in order to use it, you learn a language by using it.

Wordology is a browser add-on for Chrome and Firefox intended to help turn your foreign-language reading from homework into a natural part of your routine. Inspired by Lingq and FLTR, Wordology allows you to add translations for individual words and display them with a simple mouse-over. Words are color coded: green for known words, and red for unknown, helping visualize your progress. In addition, Wordology's "Smart Matching" heuristics will automatically detect variant forms of words such as plural nouns or conjugated verbs, saving you from having to add every single form of a word.

Wordology is written with the cross-browser [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/What_are_WebExtensions) API in plain JavaScript with no frameworks.
